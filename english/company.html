        <h1>Kista Arbetsmarknadsdag</h1>
        <p>Kista Arbetsmarknadsdag (KAM) is a career fair at KTH Kista hosted by IN-sektionen, the local chapter of the KTH Student union. Our goal is to build strong relationships between students and companies, and help our fellow students find engaging
            internships and thesis project opportunities.</p>
        <p>KAM 2018 will be held in mid-October, and we are always looking for more organizations interested in participating. We have over 1,000 ICT students studying at KTH Kista, and KAM is the best opportunity to reach those students, introduce them
            to your organization, and create new connections.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="companys" class="cont">
        <h1>Participation</h1>
        <p>If you are an organization looking to reach engineering students at KTH Kista, we would love to have you participate in KAM 2018.</p>
        <p>Organizations participating will be able to promote themselves directly in the middle of the KTH Kista campus, and be able to reach a diverse selection of ICT students. Complimentary lunches and Swedish fika will also be provided to organization
            attendees. </p>
        <p>During the career fair, Students attending will get a KAM GoodieBag with event information and promotional materials from companies. Organizations looking for more ways to engage with students during the exhibition can sign up to also add their
            own promotional material to the KAM GoodieBag. Companies can also sign up for access to an interview room to hold personal interviews with students.</p>

    <div class="cont bg-3">
        <br>
        <p>We also have opportunities for companies looking to sponsor KAM 2018. Sponsoring KAM will let your company reach students even outside of KAM. Our sponsors are marketed alongside KAM throughout October, and their company’s logo will show up on
            KAM posters and TV slides.</p>
        <p>We also offer a complimentary event outside of KAM for sponsors, of the company’s choice. Sponsors will have access to everything KAM has to offer, and will also have a personal student volunteer during the fair. Companies interested in sponsoring
            KAM are welcome to contact us for more information.</p>
        <p>We are also very interested in having start-ups participate in KAM 2018! We understand that outside promotion can be hard to fit into a start-up budget, and if you would like for your start-up to join us during KAM 2018, please contact us so we
            can figure out a package that works for your company.</p>
        <p>We have 3 packages for KAM attendees, Basic, Medium, and Sponsor. The Basic package is the easiest way for an organization to get involved with KAM, and will provide a low-cost opportunity to present your organization to students at KAM. The Medium
            package is for companies looking for more ways to engage with students, and is a good way to build strong relationships with KTH Kista students. The Sponsor package is for companies looking to get the absolute most out of KAM and are interested
            in becoming a company sponsor for KAM 2018. Sponsor packages are limited, and only three sponsor packages will be sold for KAM 2018.</p>
